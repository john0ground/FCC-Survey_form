# FCC-Survey_form
Freecodecamp's first project in their (New) Responsive Web Design curriculum.
This was my first site. 

After studying git/github, this and some of the following Freecodecamp's projects will be different from my initial code on the FCC curriculum.
I'll try to have improved changes as part of experiencing git and unix bash commands.
